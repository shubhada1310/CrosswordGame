# CrosswordGame
crossword .py is the main file that you have to run. other folder contains the documentation of the project.

It is a crossword game which are usually seen in newspaper. It is purely hard coded with Tkinter library used in python for GUI.

I've used Anaconda(notebook) as IDE. I'll recommend doing so for this project unless you are having good command on any other platform like Pycharm or sublime.
